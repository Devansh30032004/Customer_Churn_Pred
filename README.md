## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for ANN.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of a multi-layer ANN using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains customer-related information such as demographics, service usage, and account status.
